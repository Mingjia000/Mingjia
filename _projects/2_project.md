---

In this project, we will investigate the rationale of autonomy-​enabling infrastructure and its effects on future mobility systems featuring Autonomous Mobility-​on-Demand (AMoD) systems, leveraging first order principles, modeling and analytical techniques, control schemes, and simulation frameworks for the coordinated operation of fleets of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Specifically, we will study the possibility of outsourcing part of the autonomy stack of AVs to the public infrastructure, providing a detailed study of costs, benefits, scalability, and trade-​offs characterizing this approach. Furthermore, we will extend state-​of-the-art simulation frameworks for AMoD and mobility systems to assess the effects of particular infrastructural changes, and will design sound case studies for Swiss and international realities (both urban and rural).

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/project/insideout.png" title="insideout" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
