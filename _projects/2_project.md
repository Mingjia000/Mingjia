---

In this project, we will investigate the rationale of autonomy-​enabling infrastructure and its effects on future mobility systems featuring Autonomous Mobility-​on-Demand (AMoD) systems, leveraging first order principles, modeling and analytical techniques, control schemes, and simulation frameworks for the coordinated operation of fleets of autonomous vehicles (AVs). 

Specifically, we will study the possibility of outsourcing part of the autonomy stack of AVs to the public infrastructure, providing a detailed study of costs, benefits, scalability, and trade-​offs characterizing this approach. Furthermore, we will extend state-​of-the-art simulation frameworks for AMoD and mobility systems to assess the effects of particular infrastructural changes, and will design sound case studies for Swiss and international realities (both urban and rural).
