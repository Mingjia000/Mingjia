In this project, we will investigate the rationale of autonomy-​enabling infrastructure and its effects on future mobility systems featuring Autonomous Mobility-​on-Demand (AMoD) systems, leveraging first order principles, modeling and analytical techniques, control schemes, and simulation frameworks for the coordinated operation of fleets of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Specifically, we will study the possibility of outsourcing part of the autonomy stack of AVs to the public infrastructure, providing a detailed study of costs, benefits, scalability, and trade-​offs characterizing this approach. Furthermore, we will extend state-​of-the-art simulation frameworks for AMoD and mobility systems to assess the effects of particular infrastructural changes, and will design sound case studies for Swiss and international realities (both urban and rural).

The project promises to provide stakeholders of the mobility ecosystem, including governments, municipalities, mobility providers, and car-​makers, with exhaustive answers about rational trajectories for future investments and policies. Concretely, we will collaborate with SBB AG and Siemens Mobility AG. While the former partner will support the project with critical expertise in mobility planning, the latter will assist the project with knowledge about costs, procedures and trade-​offs related to the mobility infrastructure.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
