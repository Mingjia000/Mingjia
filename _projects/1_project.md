In this project, we will investigate the idea of strategic interactions of future mobility stakeholders across heterogeneous regions, such as urban areas, agglomerations, and rural areas, leveraging techniques from network design, optimization, game theory, and policy making.

Specifically, we will first provide a mathematical formulation of the problem, describing the interaction patterns between different stakeholders (mobility providers, municipalities, travelers, policy makers, investors, etc.), and characterizing their interests and constraints. We will then define solution concepts, leveraging (various) notions of system equilibria, and provide theoretical and algorithmic tools to solve the presented problems. The machinery will be implemented by extending existing simulation tools, and real world case studies will be targeted to future Swiss scenarios, designed by experts.
