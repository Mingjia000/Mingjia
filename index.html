Her works at the interaction of transportation system and robotics. Her research focuses on <strong>exploring mobility interactions and developing advanced optimization-based and learning-based methods within a game theoretical framework</strong>. <strong>Large-scale real-world datasets</strong> are utilized to demonstrate the algorithms’ efficiency and to deliver insights that guide the decision-making for future mobility systems.</p> <p>Before working at ETH, she obtained the masters’ degree in Transport Planning in Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. During her studies, she collaborated closely with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bilgeatasoy" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Bilge Atasoy</a> and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/transport-planning/staff/persoonlijke-paginas/dr-ir-p-k-krishnakumari" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Panchamy Krishnakumari</a>.
