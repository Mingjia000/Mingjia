Mingjia He is a doctoral candidate in Frazzoli's Group at the Institute of Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC), ETH Zurich. Her works at the interaction of transportation system and intelligent control. Her research focuses on exploring mobility interactions and developing advasnced optimization-based and learning-based methods within a game theoretical framework. Large-scale real-world datasets are utilized to demonstrate the algorithms' efficiency and to deliver insights that guide the decision-making for future mobility systems.
