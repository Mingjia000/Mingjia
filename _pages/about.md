Mingjia He is a doctoral student in Frazzoli's group at the Institute of Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC), ETH Zurich. Her works at the interaction of transportation system and robotics. Her research focuses on **exploring mobility interactions and developing advanced optimization-based and learning-based methods within a game theoretical framework**. **Large-scale real-world datasets** are utilized to demonstrate the algorithms' efficiency and to deliver insights that guide the decision-making for future mobility systems.

Before working at ETH, she obtained the masters' degree in Transport Planning in Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. During her studies, she collaborated closely with [Dr. Bilge Atasoy](https://sites.google.com/view/bilgeatasoy) and [Dr. Panchamy Krishnakumari](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/transport-planning/staff/persoonlijke-paginas/dr-ir-p-k-krishnakumari). She worked as a research assistant in  [Dr. Zhuge's group](http://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/people/academic/tony-zhuge/index.asp) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for two years.
