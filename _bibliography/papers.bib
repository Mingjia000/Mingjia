   abstract = {Dynamic wireless charging technology has the potential to promote the uptake of electric freight vehicles (EFVs) by allowing charging on the move. This paper presented a joint DWC lane deployment and operation model based on the trajectory data of actual EFVs. The model was formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model, with objectives to maximize saved charging time, minimize charging cost, and minimize negative impact on traffic. The model considered various constraints related to investment, facility construction, and charging decisions of EFV drivers. It was first tested on a small network and was further applied into a large-scale scenario in Beijing. The results suggested that DWC could reduce charging time by approximately 0.08–0.11 h per EFV per day within an investment limit of 67 million dollars. The deployment of DWC can be long-term profitable, resulting in a net value of 140.83 million dollars over a 25-year period.}

   title = {A data-driven integrated framework for fast-charging facility planning using multi-period bi-objective optimization},
   year = {2023},
   abstract = {With the electrification in freight transportation, the availability of fast-charging facilities becomes essential to facilitate en-route charging for freight electric vehicles. Most studies focus on planning charging facilities based on mathematical modeling and hypothetical scenarios. This study aims to develop a data-driven integrated framework for fast-charging facility planning. By leveraging the highway traffic data, we extracted, analyzed, and compared spatial and temporal flow patterns of general traffic and freight traffic. Furthermore, graph theory-based network evaluation methods are employed to identify traffic nodes within the highway network that play a significant role in accommodating charging infrastructure. A candidate selection method is proposed to obtain potential deployment locations for charging stations and to-go chargers. Based on this, we present a multi-period bi-objective optimization model to provide optimal solutions for the placement of charging facilities, with the objectives of minimizing investment cost and maximizing demand coverage. The case study on the Amsterdam highway network shows how existing traffic data can be used to generate more realistic charging demand scenarios and how it can be integrated and evaluated within the optimization framework for facility planning. The study also shows that the proposed model can leverage the potential of early investment in improving the charging demand coverage.}

   abstract = {Metro-bikeshare integration is considered a green and efficient travel model. To better develop such integration, it is necessary to monitor and analyze metro-bikeshare transfer characteristics. This paper measures access and egress transferring distances and catchment areas based on smartcard data. A cubic regression model is conducted for the exploration of the 85th access and egress network-based transferring distance around metro stations. Then, the independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to explore access and egress transfer characteristics in demographic groups and spatial and temporal dimension. Additionally, the catchment area is delineated by applying both the network-based distance method and Euclidean distance method. The result reveals that males outcompete females both in access and egress distances and urban dwellers ride a shorter distance than those in suburban areas. Access and egress distances are both shorter in morning peak hours than those in evening peak hours and access distance on weekdays is longer than that on weekends. In addition, network-based catchment area accounts for over 90% of Euclidean catchment area in urban areas, while most of the ratios are less than 85% in suburban. The paper uses data from Nanjing, China as a case study. This study serves as a scientific basis for policy makers and bikeshare companies to improve metro-bikeshare integration.},

   abstract = {Bike-sharing systems have promoted transportation sustainability in cities. Shared bikes can be used for short-distance trips or accessing public transport systems. However, the asymmetric spatiotemporal distribution of bikes across stations has become a major barrier that hinders bike-sharing adoption in cities. Before implementing policies to tackle this issue effectively, it is necessary to understand the unevenly distributed shared bikes across stations. This study proposed methods to identify the renting-returning imbalance at the station level using Nanjing bike-sharing trip dataset. Next, this study compared the spatiotemporal characteristics of imbalanced bike-sharing usage during different periods (morning peak, evening peak, and non-peak). Finally, geographically weighted multinomial logit models (GWMNL) were established to reveal the influence of exogenous variables on the renting-returning imbalance. Model results suggested that work-related points of interest (POI) could positively impact the renting-returning imbalance during peak periods. Higher population density could result in the bike-sharing renting-returning imbalance in the morning peak, and it contributed to the balance of bike-sharing in the evening. In the morning peak, higher land use mix and older people could ease the imbalance of bike-sharing. In the evening peak, longer travel time has negative impacts in most places in the study area. Based on these findings, this study provided implications for transportation planners and policymakers to balance bike-sharing systems and improve the overall service quality.},

   abstract = {As an eco-friendly travel mode, bike-sharing has prevailed around the world. However, the systems are imbalanced due to the asymmetric spatial and temporal distribution of user demand. Station prioritization strategies are needed to rebalance more shared bikes for more important stations. This paper proposes an evaluation method of station importance in dynamic bike-sharing rebalancing. Firstly, a shortterm demand prediction model is applied to capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of bike-sharing trip data and predict bike-sharing demand at the station level. Based on the prediction results, the method of determining rebalancing quantity is proposed with consideration of bike-sharing usage throughout the rebalancing period. Then, three criteria are employed to evaluate the importance of bike-sharing stations, including rebalancing quantity, closeness to inventory threshold, and distance from the key station. An entropy-based Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach is proposed to weigh different criteria and evaluate station importance. Furthermore, the experiments on bike-sharing data from Nanjing City demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This research is helpful for operators and managers to dynamically rebalance shared bikes with high efficiency and improve the service quality of bike-sharing systems.},

   abstract = {As a convenient, economical, and eco-friendly travel mode, bike-sharing greatly improved urban mobility. However, it is often very difficult to achieve a balanced utilization of shared bikes due to the asymmetric spatio-temporal user demand distribution and the insufficient numbers of shared bikes, docks, or parking areas. If we can predict the short-run bike-sharing demand, it will help operating agencies rebalance bike-sharing systems in a timely and efficient way. Compared to the statistical methods, deep learning methods can automatically learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs, requiring less assumptions and achieving higher accuracy. This study proposes a Spatial-Temporal Graph Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (STGA-LSTM) neural network framework to predict short-run bike-sharing demand at a station level using multi-source data sets. These data sets include historical bike-sharing trip data, historical weather data, users’ personal information, and land-use data. The proposed model can extract spatio-temporal information of bike-sharing systems and predict the short-term bike-sharing rental and return demand. We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to mine spatial information and adopt a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to mine temporal information. The attention mechanism is focused on both temporal and spatial dimensions to enhance the ability of learning temporal information in LSTM and spatial information in GCN. Results indicate that the proposed model is the most accurate compared with several baseline models, the attention mechanism can help improve the model performance, and models that include exogenous variables perform better than the models that only consider historical trip data. The proposed short-term prediction model can be used to help bike-sharing users better choose routes and to help operators implement dynamic redistribution strategies.},

   abstract = {Metro-bikeshare integration is considered a green and efficient travel model. To better understand bikeshare as a feeder mode to the metro, this study explored the factors that influence the activity spaces of bikeshare around metro stations. First, metro-bikeshare transfer trips were recognized by matching bikeshare smartcard data and metro smartcard data. Then, standard deviation ellipse (SDE) was used for the calculation of the metro-bikeshare activity spaces. Moreover, an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and a spatial error model (SEM) were established to reveal the effects of social-demographic, travel-related, and built environment factors on the activity spaces of bikeshare around metro stations, and the SEM outperformed OLS significantly in terms of model fit. Results show that the average metro-bikeshare activity space on weekdays is larger than that on weekends. The proportion of local residents promotes the increase in activity space on weekends, while a high density of road and metro impedes the activity space on weekdays. Additionally, with increased job density, the activity space becomes smaller significantly throughout the week. Also, both on weekdays and weekends, the closer to the central business district (CBD), the smaller the activity space. This study can offer meaningful guidance to policymakers and city planners aiming to make the bikeshare distribution more reasonable.},

  abstract = {Bike-sharing systems have rapidly expanded around the world. Previous studies found that docked and dockless bike-sharing systems are different in terms of user demand and travel characteristics. However, their usage regularity and its determinants have not been fully understood. This research aims to fill this gap by exploring smart card data of a docked bike-sharing scheme and GPS trajectory data of a dockless bike-sharing scheme in Nanjing, China, over the same period. Both docked and dockless bike-sharing users can be classified into regular users and occasional users according to their usage frequency. Two systems are cross-compared regarding their travel characteristics. Then, binary logistic models are applied to reveal the impacts of travel characteristics and built environment factors on the regularity of bike-sharing usage. Results show that for both bike-sharing systems, regular users and occasional users share similar riding time and distance, while significant differences in the spatio-temporal distribution between docked and dockless bike-sharing systems are observed. The regression model results show that the “Trips during morning and afternoon peak hours” are positively associated with the regularity of both docked and dockless bike-sharing usage. However, the “Riding distance” variable is negatively associated with the usage regularity of both systems. Built environment factors including working point of interest (POI), residential POI, and transit POI promote the usage regularity of both bike-sharing systems. Finally, policy implications are proposed, such as increasing the density of docking stations in suburban areas and developing high-quality parking area for dockless bike-sharing around public transport stations. This study can help operators or governments to launch or improve the service of bike-sharing systems.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
