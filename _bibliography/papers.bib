   abstract = {Metro-bikeshare integration is considered a green and efficient travel model. To better develop such integration, it is necessary to monitor and analyze metro-bikeshare transfer characteristics. This paper measures access and egress transferring distances and catchment areas based on smartcard data. A cubic regression model is conducted for the exploration of the 85th access and egress network-based transferring distance around metro stations. Then, the independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to explore access and egress transfer characteristics in demographic groups and spatial and temporal dimension. Additionally, the catchment area is delineated by applying both the network-based distance method and Euclidean distance method. The result reveals that males outcompete females both in access and egress distances and urban dwellers ride a shorter distance than those in suburban areas. Access and egress distances are both shorter in morning peak hours than those in evening peak hours and access distance on weekdays is longer than that on weekends. In addition, network-based catchment area accounts for over 90% of Euclidean catchment area in urban areas, while most of the ratios are less than 85% in suburban. The paper uses data from Nanjing, China as a case study. This study serves as a scientific basis for policy makers and bikeshare companies to improve metro-bikeshare integration.},

   abstract = {Bike-sharing systems have promoted transportation sustainability in cities. Shared bikes can be used for short-distance trips or accessing public transport systems. However, the asymmetric spatiotemporal distribution of bikes across stations has become a major barrier that hinders bike-sharing adoption in cities. Before implementing policies to tackle this issue effectively, it is necessary to understand the unevenly distributed shared bikes across stations. This study proposed methods to identify the renting-returning imbalance at the station level using Nanjing bike-sharing trip dataset. Next, this study compared the spatiotemporal characteristics of imbalanced bike-sharing usage during different periods (morning peak, evening peak, and non-peak). Finally, geographically weighted multinomial logit models (GWMNL) were established to reveal the influence of exogenous variables on the renting-returning imbalance. Model results suggested that work-related points of interest (POI) could positively impact the renting-returning imbalance during peak periods. Higher population density could result in the bike-sharing renting-returning imbalance in the morning peak, and it contributed to the balance of bike-sharing in the evening. In the morning peak, higher land use mix and older people could ease the imbalance of bike-sharing. In the evening peak, longer travel time has negative impacts in most places in the study area. Based on these findings, this study provided implications for transportation planners and policymakers to balance bike-sharing systems and improve the overall service quality.},

   abstract = {As an eco-friendly travel mode, bike-sharing has prevailed around the world. However, the systems are imbalanced due to the asymmetric spatial and temporal distribution of user demand. Station prioritization strategies are needed to rebalance more shared bikes for more important stations. This paper proposes an evaluation method of station importance in dynamic bike-sharing rebalancing. Firstly, a shortterm demand prediction model is applied to capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of bike-sharing trip data and predict bike-sharing demand at the station level. Based on the prediction results, the method of determining rebalancing quantity is proposed with consideration of bike-sharing usage throughout the rebalancing period. Then, three criteria are employed to evaluate the importance of bike-sharing stations, including rebalancing quantity, closeness to inventory threshold, and distance from the key station. An entropy-based Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach is proposed to weigh different criteria and evaluate station importance. Furthermore, the experiments on bike-sharing data from Nanjing City demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This research is helpful for operators and managers to dynamically rebalance shared bikes with high efficiency and improve the service quality of bike-sharing systems.},

   abstract = {As a convenient, economical, and eco-friendly travel mode, bike-sharing greatly improved urban mobility. However, it is often very difficult to achieve a balanced utilization of shared bikes due to the asymmetric spatio-temporal user demand distribution and the insufficient numbers of shared bikes, docks, or parking areas. If we can predict the short-run bike-sharing demand, it will help operating agencies rebalance bike-sharing systems in a timely and efficient way. Compared to the statistical methods, deep learning methods can automatically learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs, requiring less assumptions and achieving higher accuracy. This study proposes a Spatial-Temporal Graph Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (STGA-LSTM) neural network framework to predict short-run bike-sharing demand at a station level using multi-source data sets. These data sets include historical bike-sharing trip data, historical weather data, usersâ€™ personal information, and land-use data. The proposed model can extract spatio-temporal information of bike-sharing systems and predict the short-term bike-sharing rental and return demand. We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to mine spatial information and adopt a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to mine temporal information. The attention mechanism is focused on both temporal and spatial dimensions to enhance the ability of learning temporal information in LSTM and spatial information in GCN. Results indicate that the proposed model is the most accurate compared with several baseline models, the attention mechanism can help improve the model performance, and models that include exogenous variables perform better than the models that only consider historical trip data. The proposed short-term prediction model can be used to help bike-sharing users better choose routes and to help operators implement dynamic redistribution strategies.},

   abstract = {Metro-bikeshare integration is considered a green and efficient travel model. To better understand bikeshare as a feeder mode to the metro, this study explored the factors that influence the activity spaces of bikeshare around metro stations. First, metro-bikeshare transfer trips were recognized by matching bikeshare smartcard data and metro smartcard data. Then, standard deviation ellipse (SDE) was used for the calculation of the metro-bikeshare activity spaces. Moreover, an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and a spatial error model (SEM) were established to reveal the effects of social-demographic, travel-related, and built environment factors on the activity spaces of bikeshare around metro stations, and the SEM outperformed OLS significantly in terms of model fit. Results show that the average metro-bikeshare activity space on weekdays is larger than that on weekends. The proportion of local residents promotes the increase in activity space on weekends, while a high density of road and metro impedes the activity space on weekdays. Additionally, with increased job density, the activity space becomes smaller significantly throughout the week. Also, both on weekdays and weekends, the closer to the central business district (CBD), the smaller the activity space. This study can offer meaningful guidance to policymakers and city planners aiming to make the bikeshare distribution more reasonable.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
